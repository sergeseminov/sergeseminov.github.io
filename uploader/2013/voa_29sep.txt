Listeners are helping BBC validate World Service archive
metadata.

j.mp/1apoo24

BBC Internet Blog, 24 Sept 2013, Tristan Ferne: "The BBC World
Service Archive prototype allows you to search, browse and listen
to over 36,000 radio programmes from the BBC World Service
archive spanning the past 45 years. For a limited time you can
explore this archive and help us improve it by validating and
adding topic tags that describe the programmes. ... So far, users
of the prototype have listened to around 12,000 of the 36,000
programmes that are available and tagged or edited about 7,000 of
these. This has generated over 70,000 individual metadata 'edits'
(votes, new tags etc). We've even had some dedicated listeners
send us recordings of programmes that were missing from the
archive. We are currently analysing the data so far to see how
good the tags are by comparing professional archivists, listeners
and our algorithms."


The overlooked history of the international TV distribution
business.

j.mp/14IjsEA

Connect 2 Media & Entertainment, 25 Sept 2013, Dom Serafini:
"[O]ne can find plenty of historical references about TV
technology, production, advertising and broadcasting. But for
academia, it's as if 50 years of international TV distribution
business never existed. And yet, international program sales made
commercial television viable and fostered its growth outside the
United States. If it weren't for American international
distribution, Canada couldn't have supported its first commercial
TV stations that later formed the CTV network. If countries such
as Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil hadn't started to export
Telenovelas in the 1950s and 1960s (first selling scripts, then
kinescoped versions and later, in 1965 versions on two-inch
videotapes), Latin America's TV industry couldn't have developed
as it did. If not for TV content sold internationally, Italy
couldn't have introduced commercial television in Europe. And
yet, very few records remain of those milestones."

Deutsche Welle's departing director on the roles on shortwave,
internet, television.

j.mp/1aoyekN 

The Times of India, 19 Sept 2013, Deutsche Welle director general
Erik Bettermann as interviewed by Debasis Konar: "The importance
of shortwave has decreased dramatically almost everywhere,
largely due to increasing dominance of the internet. That's why
Deutsche Welle (DW) has reduced its shortwave radio programmes
significantly and invested more resources into its online
presence and television activities. ... Despite the increasing
importance of the Internet, radio is still a vital source of
information in many regions, where Internet access is limited. In
sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, DW not only distributes i ÿAatAsz tdirtave, but
also via partner stations. We
provide our users with audio files and podcasts in a variety of
languages. Ment <FS>oung people are accessing DW's audio offerings
through mobile devices even." [Erik Bettermann's term as director
general of DW ends 30 September.]


Director of Radio/TV Martí describes his station's media mix.

j.mp/16r0O7E

Radio Prague, 19 Sept 2013, Carlos Garcia-Perez, director of
Radio/TV Martí, a y<US>avd by Patrick McCumiskey: "We are a
multi media operation. ... Why is that? Well, there are two
primary reasons. Firstly, it's the most efficient way of carrying
on our operation today, and, as you know, the internet is a big
player. You (Radio Prague) play a big role on the internet now,
so internet and social media has changed the spectrum of how
information is disseminating and the availability of information.
Secondly, it is the attempt to jam us by the Cuban government.
And we go from the most primitive way of distributing
information, which is through flash drives and DVDs on the
island, where we put our radio and TV content to satellite. In
between those, we have an AM station, we have our own 1180 [kHz]
signal, but we buy time from commercial stations in Miami- that's
in a test period- but we do that because we know it reaches the
island, and we are getting great feedback from the island on
these. We are doing short wave and we are also testing FM. We
know the access to internet is a big component of distribution -
although we know access to the internet on the island is very
limited." [Former shortwave broadcaster Radio Prague is now
Internet-only.]

VOA's Willis Conover has a (memorial) Facebook page.

j.mp/14IjtZa

www.facebook.com/WillisConoverClub: "Willis Conover (1920-1996)
was one of VOA's treasures, an internationally-known jazz
aficionado, well-connected within the jazz community but
little-known in the United States." "Although few Americans knew
the name Willis Conover, his distinctive baritone was the voice
of jazz — that quintessentially American music — for millions
around the world. From 1955 until 1996, Conover's Music USA Jazz
Hour brought sounds that Louis Armstrong once called 'not too
slow, not too fast — kind of half-fast' to listeners of the U.S.
government-sponsored Voice of America radio service."

ISON's Approach Captured by Amateur Astronomers

VOA News
September 24, 2013

Comet ISON was spotted and photographed by amateur astronomers as
the highly-anticipated arrival of the icy space visitor nears.

"I photographed Comet ISON on September 15 using my 4-inch
refractor," reports astrophotographer Pete Lawrence of Selsey in
the United Kingdom.  "The comet's tail is nicely on view even
through this relatively small instrument."

In Aquadilla, Puerto Rico, astronomer Efrain Morales Rivera saw
the comet on September 14 "rising above the canopy of the rain
forest just minutes before sunrise. I used a 12-inch telescope,"
he said.

ISON, which will make its closest approach to the sun on November
28, has the potential to be a spectacular sight, depending on how
it reacts to the solar heating it will receive.

NASA, the U.S. space agency, said that in mid-September the
approaching comet was glowing like a star of 14th magnitude.
That's dimmer than some forecasters expected.

"Certainly we would love it to be a couple of magnitudes brighter
right now," said researcher Karl Battams of the Naval Research
Lab in Washington, D.C., "but it's doing just fine. I'd say it's
still on course to become a very eye-catching object."

NASA cautions that comets are capable of "fizzling at the last
minute even after months of promising activity."

However, if ISON survives its brush with solar fire, it could be
visible to the naked eye, NASA said.

Based on the latest images, internationally known comet expert
John Bortle said "ISON appears likely to survive the inbound leg
of its journey all the way to the Sun. It will probably brighten
more slowly than all the early hype led the public to believe.
Nevertheless, Comet ISON should very briefly become exceptionally
bright, at least rivaling the planet Venus in the hours preceding
its closest approach to the sun."

After November 28, ISON will emerge from the sun's glare
well-positioned for observers in the northern hemisphere. The
comet's tail will likely be visible to the naked-eye in both the
morning and evening sky throughout December 2013.

<b>VOA News<br>September 25, 2013</b>

An "ultra-compact dwarf galaxy" has been spotted by astronomers.

The galaxy, known as M60-UCD1, has its entire mass in a radius of only 80 light
years, compared to the Milky Way's radius of 50,000 light years. That means the
density of stars is about 15,000 times greater than the Milky Way, and the stars are
about 25 times closer.

"Traveling from one star to another would be a lot easier in M60-UCD1 than it is in
our galaxy," said Jay Strader oo: rtAan State University in Lansing, first author of
a new paper describing these resultsRouhuld still take hundreds of years using
present technology."

Scientists hope M60-UCD1, which has the mass of 200 million suns, can provide clues
on how galaxies evolved.

M60-UCD1 was seen by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and follow up observations were
made with NASA's <a href="http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2013/m60/">Chandra X-ray
Observatory</a> and ground-based optical telescopes.

The galaxy is believed to have abundant amounts of heavy elements - elements heavier
than hydrogen and helium - which makes it a "fertile environment for planets and,
potentially, life to form," said co-author Anil Seth of the University of Utah.

Another intriguing aspect of M60-UCD1 is that the Chandra data reveal the presence of
a bright X-ray source in its center. One explanation for this source is a giant black
hole weighing in at some 10 million times the mass of the Sun.

"We think nearly all of the stars have been pulled away from the exterior of what
once was a much bigger galaxy," said co-author Duncan Forbes of Swinburne University
in Australia. "This leaves behind just the very dense nucleus of the former galaxy,
and an overly massive black hole."

If that happened, the galaxy would have been 50 to 200 times more massive than it is
now.

Researchers believe the galaxy is more than 10 billion years old and that it has been
"stalled" at this size for several billion years, and it is about 60 million light
years from Earth.

A paper on M60-UCD1 has been published in the September 20th issue of <i>The
Astrophysical Journal Letters</i>.
